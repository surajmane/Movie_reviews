# Movie_reviews
The program if given a movie name as an positional argument returns back a short description of the movie and the average rating from the rating website Rottentomatoes, the name of the movie has to be the official name, for exmaple if only 'Hulk' is given in the argument it won't return anything, need to provide The incredible Hulk with underscores instead of the spaces, so to run it,
$python reviews.py The_incredible_hulk

This project contains two files and both of them needs to be in the same directory.
